QUESTION 1: Which constructor should you use?
Answer: Use the parameterized constructor Rectangle1(int xx, int yy, int w, int h)
This constructor takes 4 int parameters for x position, y position, width, and height.

QUESTION 2: Where should the Rectangle1 be declared?
Answer: The Rectangle1 should be declared as an instance variable (private field)
at the top of the class so it can be used in both the constructor and the
paintComponent method. Local variables in the constructor would disappear after
the constructor finishes.

QUESTION 3: Do the double variables work? Why not? How do you fix this?
Answer: No, double variables don't work because the Rectangle1 constructor expects
int parameters. When you try to pass a double to an int parameter, Java gives a
compile error because you'd lose precision. You fix this by either:
- Declaring them as int instead of double
- Casting them to int: (int)wid, (int)ex, (int)wy

QUESTION 4: What do you have to change the double variables to?
Answer: Change them to int variables, or cast them to int when passing them
to the constructor.
